## Overview

The Health Emergency App is designed to facilitate faster access to transportation and ambulances during health emergencies, especially in rural areas. Inspired by ride-sharing services, the app allows users to request help with a one-tap emergency button, track their location, and communicate with volunteers and drivers. It also offers health tips, first aid training, and a rewards system for active volunteers.
